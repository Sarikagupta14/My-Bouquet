            <p>The most common meaning for tulips is perfect or deep love.<br>
                Because tulips are one of the first flowers to bloom <br>
                in the spring, they can mean rebirth.<br>
                Victorians often associated tulips with charity.

                    <p>* Tulip season runs from the end of March until mid May,
                        <br/> but the flowers are usually at their best halfway through April.</p>
