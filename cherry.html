            <p>Cherry blossoms are a symbolic flower of the spring,<br>
                 a time of renewal, and the fleeting nature of life.<br>
                  Their life is very short. After their beauty peaks <br>
                  around two weeks, the blossoms start to fall.<br>
                   During this season in Japan, people like to have<br>
                    cherry blossom parties with colleagues, friends, and family</p>
                    <br>
                <p class="Heading">Bloom Season<br/></p>
                    <p>* Cherry blossom season lasts for about a month<br>
                         every spring and is always dependent on the weather. <br>
                    * Early March to early April is generally a good rule of <br>
                    thumb when you're looking at the calendar and hoping to<br>
                     see blooms.</p>
