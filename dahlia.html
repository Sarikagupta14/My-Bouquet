            Dahlias are also known as “Queen of the Garden” because<br/>
             they grow well in poor soil and withstand drought conditions.<br/>
              It is believed that Dhalia flowers bring happiness and<br/>
               good fortune. They are also considered lucky <br/>
               because they bloom during the month of Ramadan.
                <br/>
                  <br/>
                  They're even the National Garden Bureau's flower of the year for 2019!

                    <p>* Dahlias are warm-weather flowers that bloom mid-summer through fall.<br>
                        *They begin to bloom a couple of months after the soil warms, and<br>
                         continue to bloom until early to mid-fall. </p>
