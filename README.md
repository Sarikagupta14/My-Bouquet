# My-Bouquet

This project has been made using HTML and CSS.
In this project, there are collection of Beautiful Flowers and their unique significance.
You can click on particular flower significance icon (present on bottom of the left corner of each flower) and know about their speciality.
I really enjoyed and learned a lot of things related to different flowers while making this project like 
---> Symbolism of flowers in daily life we use to see and 
---> Their blooming season too.

I tried my best to add eye-catching effects too which makes it more interesting and attractive.
